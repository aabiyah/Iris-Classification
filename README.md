# Iris-Classification
This project is based on Iris Flower Classification based on three Machine Learning methods, i.e., **Decision Tree** (a supervised learning regression and classification model), **K-Nearest Neighbor** (a supervised learning classification model), and **K-Means Clustering** (an unsupervised learning clustering model for continuous data).
